# 🤖 Machine Learning Lab Cycle

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my Machine Learning Lab Cycle repository. This is where I’ve collected all the core algorithms we practiced as part of our ML coursework. Each code here is written from scratch to really understand *how things work under the hood* — no fancy libraries like scikit-learn!

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

Here are the algorithms I’ve implemented, each in its own Python file:

| 💡 Algorithm | 📄 What it Does |
|-------------|------------------|
| **A\*** | A smart pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest route from start to goal. |
| **AO\*** | Used to solve problems where outcomes are not just "yes/no" — more like decision trees with AND/OR branches. |
| **EM (Expectation Maximization)** | Helps estimate missing data or hidden variables by iterating over guesses. |
| **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** | A simple, intuitive way to classify things based on nearby examples. |
| **LWSS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)** | A cool regression method that fits a curve locally to the data points. |
| **Candidate Elimination** | An algorithm that narrows down all possible hypotheses consistent with the training data. |

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the code is saved.
4. Run:

```bash
python filename.py
